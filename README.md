Code associated with Low Rank Spectral Network Alignment 

To get started, go to the folder toy_example. The two networks to be aligned should be passed as adjacency matrices.

To regenerate the paper results, use the following 3 folders:
1. powerlaw_erdosrenyi for all power law and erdos renyi experiments
2. bio for all the bio experiments
3. dblp for the collaboration network experiment
